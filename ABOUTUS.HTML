      <h1>BIDA FIBER</h1>
       <P>Converge ICT has announced a new postpaid fiber plan that’s currently the cheapest in the market.  
        If you want fast and reliable internet connectivity for your home that doesn’t break the bank, check out the new BIDA Fiber 888.
        The new Converge BIDA Fiber 888 is aimed towards the middle class or the marginalized sector who have to rely on relatively unreliable prepaid cellular WiFi services for their internet connectivity needs. 
        For only Php888 per month, BIDA Fiber is already better than prepaid wireless WiFis as it uses fiber cables — which is proven to perform better.
        The BIDA Fiber offers speeds of up to 35Mbps with no data caps. 
        
        However, the router connection is only limited to 6 devices.
        You can apply for Converge BIDA Fiber via their website. 
        From here, enter all your personal information and address, settle the payment, and upload any government-issued ID as a requirement.
         You’d then have to schedule the appointment for installation.
        It will come with an installment fee of Php1,500 that you can pay in full, or make staggered payments of Php100/month for 18 months.  
        The BIDA Plan 888 is the only available plan as of writing. 
        But if you want something faster and better, you can try FiberX plans, which start at Php1,500/mo. 
        You can also check Converge’s prepaid fiber service called Surf2Sawa which starts at only Php50 for 1 day of unlimited internet.</P>
